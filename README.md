# html-layout-template
BEM friendly boilerplate for html layouting

## How-to start a project
Clone the project:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shdq/html-layout-template.git new-project
$ cd new-project
```

Install dependencies

``` bash
$ npm install
```

Run built-in http server

``` bash
$ npm run start
```

And let webpack watch for changes in your `.css` files to rebuild the project

``` bash
$ npm run watch
```

Open `localhost:8080` in your browser to look at the layout.

Good job! Put your markdown in `index.html` and styles in `src/css/style.css`

---
If you don't want to watch and rebuild automatically, you can build the project manually with this command:
``` bash
$ npm run build
```
