# html-layout-template
BEM friendly boilerplate for html layouting

## How-to start a project
Clone project into your directory:
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shdq/html-layout-template.git new-project
$ cd new-project
```
Install dependencies
``` bash
$ npm install
```
Good job! Put some markdown in `index.html` and styles in `src/css/style.css` now.

Next command will watch for your files and rebuild the project
``` bash
$ npm run watch
```

Check `index.html` in your browser and keep working.

Build your project when you've done
``` bash
$ npm run build
```
